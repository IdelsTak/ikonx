# IkonX - Icon Pack Browser

## Why IkonX Exists

Finding the right icon for your JavaFX project can be a hassle. I know the struggle. See, there are more than 6000 icons spread across 55 different icon packs in Ikonli. That's a lot of icon codes to comb through!

I was inspired by the AltantaFX sampler, which made browsing Material icons a breeze. So, I decided to take it a step further. I created IkonX - the Icon Pack Browser.With this tool, you can easily search, preview, and copy icon codes from **all** available icon packs. No more digging through endless documents to find that perfect icon.
